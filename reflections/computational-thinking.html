                        Computational Thinking refers to an idea of how we should structure our thoughts and plan our actions.
                        It's analogous to instructions computers are designed to handle. Whether that's effective or not I'm not really
                        sure.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Okay what I mean is, while our brains are (in a reductive sense) supercharged computers, we're capable of a whole lot more.
                        We're capable of rational thought, we're capable of feeling <span class="nes-text is-success">emotions</span>, we're capable
                        of changing and learning. Computers can't do all that. They process instructions, they execute instructions, there is no level
                        of thought in between those two processes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The class for this topic was also an offline one. The guest professor opened with a seemingly simple question, "How does a
                        phone screen know what to show you?" His objective was to ask us to begin thinking <span class="nes-text is-primary">computationally</span>
                        and think in terms of steps and algorithms.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you ask me, I don't see the point. I don't think we're designed to think like computers do, simply because we lead lives
                        that are way too much more complicated than computers.

                                <p>Not really, the entire class boils down to "there are algorithms that you can create

                        So let's see it this way, he kept talking about how we can apply computational thinking to our lives. He took
                        the example of starting a business, and being able to describe business requirements. The thing is, everything
                        in our lives, including things like these, are rapidly changing targets. There's no fixed steps to take that
                        would work <span class="nes-text is-primary">every</span> time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Even if you wanted to create some sort of algorithmic approach to doing things in your life. How would you
                        keep accounting for changes that would keep happening because of situations you couldn't account for? Would
                        you keep modifying your algorithm <span class="nes-text is-error">over</span> and <span class="nes-text is-error">over</span>?
                        I hardly think that's feasible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The better and more natural idea of course is to have a plan and awareness of the situation you're about to walk into. As you
                        move forward through the situation, you should always have the space to fail with grace, to learn and to push forward. Trying to
                        stick to an algorithm would leave you helpless.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I guess what I'm trying to ask of people is for them to <span class="nes-text is-success">live</span> as opposed to just processing instructions laid out
                        for them.
