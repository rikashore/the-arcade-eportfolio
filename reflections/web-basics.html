                        I am going to preface this by saying, I really didn't think much about this chapter. I learned about
                        HTML and CSS a long time ago while I was beginning my programming journey and over time I just moved
                        on to bigger projects and newer programming languages.

                                <p>Come on, you must have felt something about this chapter.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Okay... Well going through that chapter did inspire me to write some HTML and
                                    CSS again.
                                </p>

                                <p>See, you did think <em>something</em> of this chapter. Did you end up
                                doing anything cool?</p>

                                    Yep, in fact this entire website that you're reading my thoughts on
                                    was structured in HTML by myself and styled by myself (with the help of NES.css of course).
                                </p>
                            </div>

                        Okay, so well not exactly nothing, but in reality the chapter felt more of a refresher course than anything, still
                        it pushed me to make this website, so maybe it was invaluable after all.
