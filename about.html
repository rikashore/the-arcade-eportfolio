                            My name is Aarav (as you probably know by now), I'm an aspiring writer who is looking to do
                            psychology by trade. I tend to dabble in philosophy and do a bunch of programming projects ranging
                            from the severely useless to the particularly useful.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I didn't start out my academic journey with these goals in mind. To be honest I wanted to go into the
                            field of computer science engineering, the money was supposedly good and the jobs plentiful, but some
                            part of me just couldn't get behind the idea of having to do that as my daily routine. It felt like I
                            was losing the plot and that doing it as a career would take the joy that I get from programming away.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Soon enough I found myself pivoting over to my passion, the field of psychology. My goal is to eventually
                            become a clinical psychologist, being able to help people find their way in an absolutely gloomy world
                            right now just sounds like a dream. That's also why I'm here at FLAME, to help me achieve that goal.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Along the way I picked up a few hobbies and skills, I did graphic design for a while, I found my passion
                            for video games, and my interest in philosopy. I follow the school of Absurdism (Great answer for those
                            who want to know more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/11z5v7l/what_is_absurdism_actually_about/">here</a>)
                            These hobbies and ideas introduced me to people I never thought I would have met earlier ever before, and for that I am every
                            bit grateful.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now as I move along, I'm waiting to see what's in store for me ahead... and I'm kinda hoping to still find the time
                            to become a best selling novelist one day ;)
