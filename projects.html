                                        Disqord is an asynchronous, C# based wrapper around the API for the popular chat app Discord.
                                        I've made several contributions to the library over time implementing key features as changes came along in Discord's API.

                                        Disqord was the first large-scale open source project that I ever contributed to.
                                        It taught me a lot about things like Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and
                                        how to work within a larger group.

                                        <br>
                                        Disqord was also my stepping stone to go forth to create my own open source 
                                        projects. It also taught me the way to set up larger projects to allow for it to be contributed
                                        to by other people to allow it to grow.

                                <h4>About</h4>
                                <p class="nes-text is-primary">
                                    Exhaust is an analyser extension/tool for the Go language. It's purpose is to help detect whether type switches in
                                    source code were "exhaustive" or not (hence the name). It was made both as a learning experience because at the time
                                    I was unfamiliar with the Go language and as a tool to help out an online acquaintance who was working on a compiler in Go.

                                <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                                <p class="nes-text is-primary">
                                    My key takeaway is probably the knowledge I gained about Go. I love learning about new programming languages whenever
                                    I can and so I'll take just about any excuse to try something new.

                                    <br>
                                    I also learned something new about the design of programming language ecosystems, such as in the case of Go, where the language allows for and even encourages people
                                    building their own tools.
                                </p>

                                    Noctilus is an implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/knight-lang/knight-lang">Knight</a>
                                    programming language. It's made in Java and acted as a learning exercise in modern Java features.

                                <p class="nes-text is-primary">
                                    I learned about modern Java features and more about how to follow specifications. I also learned about the
                                    value of good specifications as it was really easy for me to follow along with the logic and ideas
                                    presented as part of the Knight programming language.
